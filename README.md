## Hey, I'm Sanda ANDRIA! 👋

I'm a **passionate tech enthusiast** who loves all things **software, data engineering, and AI**. Armed with a geeky streak and a curious mind, I’m constantly exploring new technologies, optimizing complex data workflows, and crafting scalable solutions that push the boundaries of what's possible.

**What I’m up to:**

- 🔭 Currently working on **data engineering and AI projects**, blending cutting-edge machine learning models with robust, scalable data pipelines.
- 🌱 Diving into **DevOps for data**—thinking infrastructure-as-code, CI/CD, and cloud orchestration for data-driven systems.
- ⚡ Always learning: I stay up-to-date with emerging tech, best practices, and industry trends. If there’s a new framework, library, or tool, I’m probably already tinkering with it!
